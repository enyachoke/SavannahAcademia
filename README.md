# Savannah Academia Frontend
This is a school management system for Kenyan schools (Primary and Secondary) I created it based on how I understand
the system and some of the concepts  may be wrong but my main aim was to learn angular 2 by solving a real problem.
This is far from ready for production but the ground work is done and I will be adding more features at my own pace. Consider this as something you can use to learn angular 2. Anyways if you wish to contribute just send you pull requests.

The backend is done in Ruby on Rails and can be found here https://github.com/enyachoke/SavannahAcademia-API
